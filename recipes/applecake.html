    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>With chunks of sweet apples nestled in a tender and buttery rum cake, this French apple cake is the essence of simplicity.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 stick (½ cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>⅔ cup granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling over cake</li>
        <li>2 Large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dark rum</li>
        <li>2 baking apples, peeled, cored and cut into ½-inch cubes (I like Honeycrisp, Fuji or Granny Smith) (3½ - 4 cups chopped)</li>
        <li>Confectioners' sugar (optional), for decorating cake</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and set an oven rack in the middle position. Grease a 9-inch springform or regular cake pan with butter or nonstick cooking spray. If using a regular cake pan, line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and grease again.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
        <li>Using a handheld mixer with beaters or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Beat in the vanilla and rum. Don't worry if the batter looks grainy at this point; that's okay. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until just combined. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the chopped apples.</li>
        <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and even the top. Sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool on a rack in the pan. Once cool, run a blunt knife around the edges of the cake. If using a springform pan, remove the sides. If using a regular cake pan, carefully invert the cake onto the rack, remove the parchment paper, then gently flip the cake over and place right-side-up on a platter. Using a fine sieve, dust with confectioners' sugar (if using). Cake can be served warm or room temperature, plain or with lightly sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.</li>
        <li>Freezer Friendly Instructions: The cake can be frozen for up to 3 months. After it is completely cooled, wrap it tightly with aluminum foil or freezer wrap. Thaw overnight on the countertop before serving.</li>
    </ol>
